# Israelian Names Analysis  
This project is a data analysis of given names in Israel from the years 1948 to 2021. The data is divided into two categories: males and females, and is further divided by religion (Jews, Muslims, and Christians).

## Data  
The data for this project was sourced from the [Central Bureau of Statistics](https://www.cbs.gov.il/en/Pages/default.aspx#DeltaPlaceHolderMain) and is stored in an Excel file called Names.xlsx. The file contains six sheets, one for each combination of gender and religion.

## Analysis
The script reads in the data from the Excel file, concatenates the data frames, and performs some basic data cleaning.

## Visualization
The script also includes a function called plot_name that allows the user to search for a given name and plot the popularity of the name over time.
